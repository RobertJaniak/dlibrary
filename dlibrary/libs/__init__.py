"""Package for all used 3rd party libs.

We should have as less 3rd party dependencies as possible.
DLibrary is meant to be an OOP wrapper around the vs calls, and should make plugin development way easier.
DLibrary should focus on that purpose only. If for some reason, other types of packages/modules would be great to have,
then other libraries should be created with that purpose, like for example, a specialized math module etc....
